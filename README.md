# What are gHacks?

gHacks are a set of challenge based hackathons that can be hosted in-person or virtually via Google Meet.

Attendees work in squads of 3 to 5 people to solve a series of technical challenges for a given technology or solution scenario. Challenges describe high-level tasks and goals to be accomplished. gHacks are **NOT** step-by-step labs.

gHacks are designed to be a collaborative learning experience.  Attendees "learn from" and "share with" each other. Without giving step-by-step instructions for the challenges, attendees have to work hard to solve the challenges together as a team.  This results in greater knowledge retention for the attendees. 

Squads are not left on their own to solve the challenges. Coaches work with each squad to provide guidance for, but not answers to, the challenges.  The coaches may also provide lectures and/or demos to introduce concepts needed to solve the challenges, as well as review challenge solutions throughout the event.

# How to Host gHacks

Would you like to host a gHack for your organization? The gHack format and content has been designed for hosting a hack with groups of 5 to 50 people. We welcome anyone to use the content here to host their own gHacks event!

See our complete guide on [How To Host a gHack](./faq/howto-host-hack.md).

# How to Contribute to gHacks

gHacks are community driven. Here are our core principles:
- Anyone can [contribute a new hack](./faq/howto-author-hack.md).
- Anyone can use the content to [host their own gHacks event](./faq/howto-host-hack.md).
- Anyone can modify or update a hack as needed.
  - Contributing updates back via a [pull request](./faq/howto-author-hack.md) is encouraged.
- The content can be shared with attendees AFTER the event for continuity purposes.

Would you like to contribute to gHacks?  We welcome new hacks and updates to existing hacks.  Please reach out to ginof@ and meken@.

# How to Author gHacks

What makes a good hack? We have a guide that helps answer that question!

Hacks can focus on a single technology or focus on a solution scenario that features multiple technologies working together to solve a business problem.

Read our [gHacks Author's Guide](./faq/howto-author-hack.md) for details on how to author a hack. The author's guide contains a set of markdown template files that help you quickly create new hack content that is consistent with the gHack format.
