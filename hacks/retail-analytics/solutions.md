- Challenge 1: Replicating Oracle Data Using Datastream
   - Backfill the Oracle FastFresh schema and replicate updates to Cloud Storage in real time.
- Challenge 2: Creating a Dataflow Job using the Datastream to BigQuery Template
   - Now itâ€™s time to create a Dataflow job which will read from GCS and update BigQuery. You will deploy the pre-built Datastream to BigQuery Dataflow streaming template to capture these changes and replicate them into BigQuery.
- Challenge 3: Analyzing Your Data in BigQuery
